# AR/VR Project (1707981)
## Ideas
Ideally, my project will include: 

* An explorable area despite the challenges of movement in VR
* Fast-paced non-static gameplay
* Achievable to create along with the frog game assignment, comp220 assignment and CPD

### Zombie Tag
A game where you play as a crawling zombie on the ground, chasing down fleeing humans and tagging them so they become zombies too.  

A crawling motion is used to move, ideally reducing motion sickness by restricting camera movement to snappy pulls made by the user's arms. 

#### Mechanics
* Using your hands, pull yourself forwards along the ground by touching the ground and pulling the trigger.

### Giant Tag
A game where you play as a giant in a big city. It's pretty simple. Smash everything! Destroy the world! Pick up planes and throw them at buildings or other planes, smash your fist down on skyscrapers, grab the ground and pull yourself along whilst crushing everything below you.  

#### Mechanics
* Using your hands, destroy everything.
* Also you can pull yourself along the ground in a similar way to the zombie game, or perhaps take the Sprint Vector approach where you swing your arms.

### Frog Game except you're Hanging on the Tree
A VR version of the Frog game we're making in the group. It's a platformer where you play as a frog and use your tongue for sick movements and stuff. Currently, the extent of the game is not strictly defined, but a level could be defined for the VR prototype. The level could include: Dodging cannonballs, riding an updraught up the centre of a tree trunk, breakable walls that the player can break, jumping super high and tongue-swinging targets. The focus of the level could be around gaining height so at the end the player can look down upon the world.  

The player's perspective is from the heights of trees around the area, giving you a bird's eye view of the main character. Player movement only occurs via the trees, which you could teleport or pull yourself to. Alternatively, based on Astro Bot's strategy, the camera could move in straight lines across the trees at a relatively fixed speed.  

#### Mechanics
* Flinging your hand out elastically, grabbing the tree and pulling yourself toward it  
* Using the trackpad to drive the character
* Tongue-swinging (somehow)
* Jumping and double-jumping for verticality.

## Challenges
The main challenge for this is achieving freedom of movement without causing motion sickness from VIMS, visually-induced motion sensitivity. This creates a disparity between the sense of movement in the inner ear (vestibular system) and the movement the player sees themself achieving.  

Some remedies to this could include:
* Increasing the user's control and ability to stop, perhaps by using the hands to dictate movement
* Reducing acceleration time (making movement 'snappier' rather than slow and steady)
* Tilting the user virtually: perhaps associating the user's 'down vector' with their direction of movement could compensate the lack of vestibular stimili, by letting the real-life gravity provide the force.
* * i.e. because you're tilting in game as you move to the side, you can still feel the force in real life, but it's just natural gravity. Of course, the force of gravity is static, which means it won't have the feeling of added force, but it would reduce the visual-vestibular disparity slightly.

## Existing games achieving successful movement schemes
### Sprint Vector
Developed by Survios and released in 2017, Sprint Vector is a fast-paced VR platformer that essentially breaks all the rules of 'don't move the player or they will projectile vomit'. Rather, in this case the player _is_ basically the projectile.  

Movement is achieved by swinging your arms, probably creating the level of control essential to making the player feel slightly less dizzy. 

MetaCritic gave SprintVector an 84/100. Many reviewers cited its uses as an impromptu fitness program for your aching arms and well-adjusted, motion sickness-calibrated controls. It has been described as an 'adrenaline rush' [2] and has achieved Gold for sales on Steam [1].

### Astro Bot
Released in 2018 by JapanStudio, Astro Bot is a critically-acclaimed VR platformer, scoring a 90 on MetaCritic [3]. It seemingly uses an on-rails camera, characterised as a robot effectively canonically putting the player into the game. Attacks of goo and bullets toward this robot character encourage the player to dodge with their body, adding a level of immersion.  

This game confirms that platformers are viable in VR, making the VR-ization of the frog game reasonable especially if it incorporates some directly player-oriented gameplay. The curious thing about Astro Bot is how it successfully implements a moving view when doing so is unrecommended. Actually, the main recommendation is that acceleration should be avoided, rather than constant movement. This is shown in Astro Bot gameplay videos where camera acceleration and deceleration is quick and snappy.
