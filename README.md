# AR/VR Project (1707981)
## Ideas
My ideas will mostly on incorporating comfortable movement into the VR space so that the player has freedom to explore. Ideally a fast-paced experience despite the challenges.

### Zombie Tag
An ideally multiplayer game where you play as a crawling zombie on the ground, chasing humans down and tagging them so they become zombies to.  

Take notes of VR/AR guidelines for motion sickness.

#### Mechanics
* Using your hand

### Frog Game except you're Hanging on the Tree
A VR version of the Frog game we're making in the group. It's a platformer where you play as a frog and use your tongue for sick movements and stuff.  

The player's perspective is from the heights of trees around the area, giving you a bird's eye view of the main character. Player movement only occurs via the trees, which you could teleport or pull yourself to.  

#### Mechanics
* Flinging your hand out elastically, grabbing the tree and pulling yourself toward it  
* Using either the trackpad or laser pointers  

## Challenges
The main challenge for this is achieving freedom of movement without causing motion sickness from VIMS, visually-induced motion sensitivity. The main problem for this is the disparity between the sense of movement in the inner ear (vestibular system) and the movement the player sees themself achieving.  

Some remedies to this could include:
* Increasing the user's control and ability to stop, perhaps by using the hands to dictate movement
* Reducing acceleration time (making movement 'snappier' rather than slow and steady)
* Tilting the user virtually: perhaps associating the user's 'down vector' with their direction of movement could compensate the lack of vestibular stimili, by letting the real-life gravity provide the force.
* * i.e. because you're tilting in game as you move to the side, you can still feel the force in real life, but it's just natural gravity. Of course, the force of gravity is static, which means it won't have the feeling of added force, but it would reduce the visual-vestibular disparity slightly.

## Existing games achieving successful movement schemes
### Sprint Vector
Developed by Survios and released in 2017, Sprint Vector is a fast-paced VR platformer that essentially breaks all the rules of 'don't move the player or they will projectile vomit'. Rather, in this case the player is basically the projectile.  

Movement is achieved by swinging your arms, probably creating the level of control essential to making the player feel slightly less dizzy. 

MetaCritic gave SprintVector an 84/100. Many reviewers cited its uses as an impromptu fitness program for your aching arms and well-adjusted, motion sickness-calibrated controls.
